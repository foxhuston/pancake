Pancake
=======

Soon to be a chatterbot for IRC. Inspired by the bot of questionable origin in #optacular.

Note, pancake doesn't build at the moment. In fact, it's pretty totally broken.

ToDo
====

* Get pancake to a building state again
* Build libary for dealing with IRC messages as Haskell types (aka not strings).
* ~~Save the Markov Map to disk~~ Done!
* Come up with a cleaner (reactive?) way to deal with IRC events
  * An interesting corollary to this: learn an FRP library.
* ~~Figure out how to record proper stops~~ Done, with thanks to [StrmSrfr](https://github.com/StrmSrfr).
